#To do List Upgraded

This document describes the Final Project for the class "Web Application".

##Description

This Web App is meant to organize tasks for the user. The user will enter with data about tasks that he needs to accomplish, containing its name, duo date, priority, etc. Then he will be able to see the list of tasks that he still needs to do and the ones that he has done or expired. An interesting functionality is that the app will order the tasks, returning a list with the sequence that would be better for the user to do.

+ We still need to think more about more functionalities to add

##Specific operations

*  User <CRUD>
*  Tasks <CRUD>
*  Sort Tasks
*  View Tasks on Calendar
